###A few reasons why I took this course

>I have been interested in learning more about GIT and version control in general. My previous experience with it has been quite a >mess; where files werenâ€™t sorted well and only acted as a portable online storage for myself rather than sharing my work with >others. I am currently doing a Software Project, where using we are using BitBucket and GIT for version control. It is essential to >know how to use it properly since six other people are also adding their changes to it. Therefore, taking this course for learning >about GIT is already worth it.  I have made websites before using third party software and HTML. However, this is my first time >using GITHUB Pages. It is interesting version control with a visual depiction of your code in a form of a webpage. So far, I am >satisfied with the learning material. It is easy to understand, and I have learned things I directly applied to my assignments. The >Markdown Language lessons were a great example of swift learning. This course being a completely online meant convenience more than >anything else. I am looking forward to learning more about GITHUB and other Developing skills that I will learning from this course.
