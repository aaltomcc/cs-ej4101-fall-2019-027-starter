# A few reasons why I took this course

>I have been interested in learning more about **GIT** and version control in general. My previous experience with it has been quite a mess; where files weren’t sorted well and only acted as a portable online storage for myself rather than sharing my work with others. I am currently doing a Software Project, where using we are using **BitBucket** and **GIT** for version control. It is essential to know how to use it properly since six other people are also adding their changes to it. Therefore, taking this course for learning about **GIT** is already worth it.  I have made websites before using third party software and **HTML**. However, this is my first time using **GITHUB Pages**. It is interesting version control with a visual depiction of your code in a form of a webpage. So far, I am satisfied with the learning material. It is easy to understand, and I have learned things I directly applied to my assignments. The Markdown Language lessons were a great example of swift learning. This course being a completely online meant convenience more than anything else. I am looking forward to learning more about **GITHUB** and other Developing skills that I will learning from this course.

# A few things I have learned while making this Website:

>Before, this course I did not even know you could make a website using GITHUB. Though I have made websites before, something about making one by using GITHUB made it more satisfying. Perhaps, it was the blend of version control using GIT and viewing it using GITHUB Pages. I got introduced to the Markdown Language via the online lessons. Some things like the Italic, Bold and the Header were familiar. However, most of the things were quite new to me. Adding links and images felt like the important things I have learned when it comes to the lessons. Another thing I’ve learned was that the pages don’t get updated immediately as you commit your changes. It usually takes a few minutes until the changes can be seen in the website. One thing I was stuck on was first title of the website. The title was the following:
>
>>cs-ej4101-fall-2019-027-starter
>Even though it was not mentioned in the Diary-027.md file. A coordinator had posted a recommendation in Slack on how to fix this problem. A config.yml file had to be made, where I could add my preferred title. The additional files like a README, GITIGNORE and etc have to be added too as this is a version control folder. However, I was familiar with these from previous projects.
