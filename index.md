# About a student who refused to bow:
I am a student in Aalto University. I am embarrased to see my fellow students glued to their phones; some of who end up smacking their face on a wall. These phone zombies have no idea how vunerable their lives will be when technology starts to take control of their housekeys, transactions, clothes and etc. Hence, there will be a big demand for Cyber Security in the upcoming decades. 

I myself am interested in the concept of security. The idea of protecting the weaklings can feel both heroic and sadistic. Why? Well, it is heroic in the sense that we are defending the ones that can't defend themselves. However, it is also sadistic in the sense that we get to decide the fate of these people.
